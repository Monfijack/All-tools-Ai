    <section id="faq">
      <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <h3>1. What is PLR and is it legal to use?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> PLR stands for Private Label Rights — licensing that lets you rebrand, edit, and resell digital products as your own. The bundle includes a clear PLR license, giving you full commercial rights to customize and resell the cute garden designs — 100% legally, with no royalties or attribution needed.</p>

      <h3>2. Is PLR good for beginners who don’t know design or marketing?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Absolutely. PLR is popular among beginners because it saves time and avoids starting from scratch. This product provides ready-to-sell designs, editable Canva templates, and done-for-you sales pages and email swipe files — a complete package perfect for those with zero skills.</p>

      <h3>3. Can I really make money from PLR products? How do I market them?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes! List on Etsy/Shopify, use social media marketing, and email funnels. You get social media post templates, email swipe files, and a step-by-step guide on where and how to sell, including Etsy and print-on-demand (POD) strategies.</p>

      <h3>4. Will my products look generic if they are PLR?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only if you don’t customize them. The Canva files let you easily tweak colors, fonts, and text, ensuring your products look fresh and unique.</p>

      <h3>5. Can I use PLR products to build my email list or lead magnets?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Definitely. PLR is often used to create opt-in freebies. Holistic tools like planners and journals can be repurposed as lead magnets to attract and convert subscribers.</p>

      <h3>6. Do I need advanced tools or Canva Pro to use PLR designs?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Not necessarily. All assets work with the free version of Canva. Mockups come ready-made — no premium tools required.</p>

      <h3>7. How do I avoid markets being flooded with the same PLR designs?</h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use niche targeting, slight customization, or bundle PLR with other products to stand out. You’re encouraged to edit and brand them. Plus, the bonus guide shares ideas on niching down and adding value.</p>
