            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cannot resell the PLR license itself</strong> (buyers can't redistribute as PLR).</li>
                <li>Some marketplaces (e.g., Creative Market) restrict PLR reselling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>üí° Use Case:</strong> A <strong>digital agency</strong> rebrands the bundle as <strong>"Tiny Zen Gardens"</strong> and sells it to <strong>yoga studios</strong> as a lead magnet.</p>
            
            <h4>üöÄ Which Feature is MOST Valuable For You?</h4>
            <p>If you're a <strong>seller who hates design work</strong>, the <strong>ready-made PNG/SVGs</strong> are a lifesaver. For <strong>marketers</strong>, the <strong>done-for-you ads</strong> save the most time. Beginners will love the <strong>reselling guide</strong>, while <strong>scalers</strong> benefit most from the <strong>PLR license</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Hurdles:</strong> If you're new to <strong>digital product sales</strong> (Etsy, Gumroad, etc.), you'll need to learn basic platform rules (e.g., file uploads, SEO).

            <h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ Interface Analysis: Simple File-Based System</h4>

            <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation:</strong> Since it's <strong>not a SaaS tool</strong>, you'll need to manage files manually (Google Drive/Dropbox recommended). No built-in preview feature‚Äîyou'll need to open files to view them.</p>
