            <p><strong>Use Case:</strong><br>
            A fitness affiliate takes a viral "home workout" video, adds an opt-in form offering a free diet plan, and captures leads right from the video itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br>

                    <li><strong>Upsells Add Key Features</strong><br>
                    The full potential of VidMagnet (like unlimited funnels, automation, or whitelabel rights) is locked behind optional upgrades (OTOs), which may increase the cost for serious users.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Requires Internet to Function</strong><br>
                    As a fully cloud-based app, it doesn't work offline—so a stable connection is essential for access and editing.</li>
